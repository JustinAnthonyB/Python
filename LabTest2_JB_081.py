'''
(10 points) A function that takes two string parameters (arguments). 
The function should then check is the first string is present as a substring in the second parameter. 
If it is found it should return its index position (beginning index and end index). 
(10 points) A function that takes a dictionary as an argument (parameter). 
The function then asks for the user input for a key (diet choice) 
and return the value of that key (measure of the average carbon footprint. 
If the diet choice is not in the dictionary, the function should display a relevant message.  
The list to be used to test this function in main is 
diet_carbon_footprint={"vegan": 955, "vegetarian": 1053, "pescatarian": 1431, "omnivorous": 2282}
(10 points) A function that takes a list and a filename as parameters then write the list to the file.
The list you can use to test this function in main is: 
myths=[ "Drinking milk can help you lose weight", "Milk is natureâ€™s perfect food", "People need milk to be healthy". 
The file name you can use to test the function is dairy_myths.csv and has the following content:
Milk builds strong bones
Cow milk is the best source of calcium
 (10 points) Rewrite the function immediately above, rename it by ending the function name with "_ex" 
 and add all appropriate exceptions. 
(10 points) Create a main function to test the functions created above. 
Save the module in the format "LabTest2_XY_999.py" in which XY are the initials of your first and 
last name and 999 are the last 3 digits of your student number.
